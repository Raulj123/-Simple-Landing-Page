## Objective:
Your task is to create a simple landing page that includes a header, hero section, and a contact form. The page should be responsive and visually appealing.

## Design Considerations 🎨 :
To align with the company's branding, I incorporated their color theme and integrated some of their impactful slogans from [Zymo Reaserach](https://www.zymoresearch.com/) into the website. This ensures a consistent and engaging user experience.

## Project Structure 🏗️ :
To maintain a well-organized and scalable codebase, I followed a structured approach for organizing files and stylesheets:

```
- root
  - index.html
  - assets
    - css
      - aboutStyles.css
      - footerStyle.css
      - formStyle.css
      - heroStyle.css
      - navStyle.css
    - js
      - script.js
  - media
    - banner.jpg
    - bullseye_icon.jpg
    - checkmark_icon.jpg
    - ....
    - footer-icons
      - facebook_icon.png
      - ....
```
## Tech Stacks 🧰 :

## Challenges Faced 💪 :
While working on this project, I encountered a few challenges:

1. **No CSS libraries or frameworks**: Not being able to rely on pre-built CSS libraries or frameworks made the project more challenging. However, it allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of CSS and its capabilities.
2. **Responsive Hero Section**: Making the hero section responsive and visually appealing was a key focus. Ensuring proper layout and usability across different devices required careful planning and testing.
3. **Footer Responsiveness**: Designing a responsive footer that adapts well to various screen sizes posed its own set of challenges. I leveraged available resources and best practices to achieve the desired outcome.

## Features ✨ :
- Fully responsive design: The landing page adapts to different devices and screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience.
- Mobile hamburger menu: On mobile devices, a hamburger menu is implemented to enhance navigation and improve usability.
- Form validation: The contact form includes form validation to prevent users from submitting empty fields or entering only blank spaces.
- Responsive footer: The footer section is also responsive and includes clickable logos that redirect users to the respective company websites.

## Installation 📥 :
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the GitHub repository: git clone [repository URL]
- Navigate to the project directory: cd [project directory]
- Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage 💻 :
- Scroll through the landing page to explore the different sections and features.
- Click on the "Inquire Now" button in the hero section to scroll down to the contact form.
- Fill out the contact form fields with valid information, ensuring that no fields are left empty or contain only blank spaces.
- Click the submit button to see a success message if all required fields are properly filled.

## Resources 📚 :
During the development of this project, I utilized the following resources:

- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/): I sourced font images and icons from Icons8, which provided high-quality visuals for the landing page.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/): I referred to W3Schools to learn and implement various web development techniques.
